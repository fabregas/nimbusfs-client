Access rights controlled by operation system. In <em>Webdav</em> mode access from <em>localhost</em> allowed without login and password, if you change <b>Webdav hostname</b> to something different from <em>‘127.0.0.1’</em>, client will listent on <b>Webdav port</b> on that address and allow connections with authorization.
